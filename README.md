# StackOverflow Client - WPF Application

This is a C# solution for testing new ideas, features and frameworks etc.
Solution is based on desktop WPF + MVVM application with Unity container used to manage all tested dependencies.
This approach allows you to replace components with another one that implements the same interface.
